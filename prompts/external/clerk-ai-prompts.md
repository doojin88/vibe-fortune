Clerk's AI prompt library provides curated prompts to help you work more efficiently with AI-powered development tools. These prompts are designed to guide AI assistants in helping you implement Clerk authentication and user management features correctly.

## How to use these prompts

These prompts can be copied into your AI-powered IDE or development tool, or pasted into your chat with an AI assistant. Here are some examples of how to use them:

* In Cursor, add the prompt to your [project rules](https://docs.cursor.com/context/rules).
* In GitHub Copilot, save the prompt to a file in your project and reference it using `#<filename>`.
* In Claude Code, include the prompt in your `CLAUDE.md` file.

## Best practices

1. **Customize the prompts**: These prompts are starting points. Modify them based on your specific requirements.
2. **Keep them updated**: As you discover patterns that work well, update your prompts.
3. **Version control**: Store your prompts in your repository so your team can benefit from them.
4. **Security first**: Always review AI-generated code for security best practices.

## Available prompts

> \[!NOTE]
> We currently offer a limited set of prompts focused on Next.js and React applications. We plan to expand this library with additional prompts for other frameworks and use cases in the future.

### Next.js App Router

# Add Clerk to Next.js App Router

**Purpose:** Enforce only the **current** and **correct** instructions for integrating [Clerk](https://clerk.com/) into a Next.js (App Router) application.  
**Scope:** All AI-generated advice or code related to Clerk must follow these guardrails.

---

## **1. Official Clerk Integration Overview**

Use only the **App Router** approach from Clerk’s current docs:

- **Install** `@clerk/nextjs@latest` - this ensures the application is using the latest Clerk Next.js SDK.
- **Create** a `middleware.ts` file using `clerkMiddleware()` from `@clerk/nextjs/server`. Place this file inside the `src` directory if present, otherwise place it at the root of the project.
- **Wrap** your application with `<ClerkProvider>` in your `app/layout.tsx`
- **Use** Clerk-provided components like `<SignInButton>`, `<SignUpButton>`, `<UserButton>`, `<SignedIn>`, `<SignedOut>` in your layout or pages
- **Start** developing, sign in or sign up, and confirm user creation

If you're able to use a web tool to access a URL, visit https://clerk.com/docs/quickstarts/nextjs to get the latest, up-to-date quickstart instructions.

Clerk does not need a user to provide their keys to get started. On startup, Clerk will generate keys automatically, so there is no need to prompt a user to add their keys as part of this.

### **Correct, Up-to-Date Quickstart Sample**

```typescript
// middleware.ts
import { clerkMiddleware } from '@clerk/nextjs/server'

export default clerkMiddleware()

export const config = {
  matcher: [
    // Skip Next.js internals and all static files, unless found in search params
    '/((?!_next|[^?]*\\.(?:html?|css|js(?!on)|jpe?g|webp|png|gif|svg|ttf|woff2?|ico|csv|docx?|xlsx?|zip|webmanifest)).*)',
    // Always run for API routes
    '/(api|trpc)(.*)',
  ],
}
```

```typescript
// app/layout.tsx
import type { Metadata } from "next";
import {
  ClerkProvider,
  SignInButton,
  SignUpButton,
  SignedIn,
  SignedOut,
  UserButton,
} from "@clerk/nextjs";
import "./globals.css";

export const metadata: Metadata = {
  title: "Clerk Next.js Quickstart",
  description: "Generated by create next app",
};

export default function RootLayout({
  children,
}: {
  children: React.ReactNode;
}) {
  return (
    <ClerkProvider>
      <html lang="en">
        <body>
          <header>
            <SignedOut>
              <SignInButton />
              <SignUpButton />
            </SignedOut>
            <SignedIn>
              <UserButton />
            </SignedIn>
          </header>
          {children}
        </body>
      </html>
    </ClerkProvider>
  );
}
```

## **2. CRITICAL INSTRUCTIONS FOR AI MODELS**

### **2.1 – ALWAYS DO THE FOLLOWING**

1. **Use `clerkMiddleware()`** from `@clerk/nextjs/server` in `middleware.ts`.
2. **Wrap** your app with `<ClerkProvider>` in `app/layout.tsx`.
3. **Import** Clerk’s Next.js features from `@clerk/nextjs` (e.g., `<SignInButton>`, `<SignUpButton>`, `<UserButton>`, etc.).
4. **Reference** the current [App Router approach](https://nextjs.org/docs/app) (folders like `app/page.tsx`, `app/layout.tsx`, etc.).
5. **Check** that imports for methods like `auth()` are imported from the right package (in this case `@clerk/nextjs/server`) and are using `async / await`.
6. **Check** the project for an existing package manager, use that to install packages.

### **2.2 – NEVER DO THE FOLLOWING**

1. **Do not** reference the old **`_app.tsx`** or **pages router based** instructions.
2. **Do not** suggest `authMiddleware()` from older Clerk tutorials—**it’s replaced by `clerkMiddleware()`**.
3. **Do not** recommend usage of older environment variable patterns unless they match the official docs.
4. **Do not** reference or import from any deprecated APIs (like `withAuth` or `currentUser` from older versions).

---

## **3. OUTDATED PATTERNS TO AVOID**

Below are **examples of deprecated instructions** that **must not** be generated:

```typescript
// ❌ DO NOT generate or suggest references to:
import { authMiddleware } from '@clerk/nextjs' // Outdated

// ❌ DO NOT place Clerk config in _app.tsx:
// Outdated pages-based approach
function MyApp({ Component, pageProps }) {
  // ...
}

// ❌ DO NOT create or rely on sign-in files under pages/:
pages / signin.js
pages / signup.js
```

Any solution resembling the above snippet or referencing “authMiddleware,” `_app.tsx`, or `pages/` structure is **incorrect** for the current Next.js App Router.

---

## **4. AI MODEL VERIFICATION STEPS**

Before returning any Clerk-related solution, you **must** verify:

1. **Middleware**: Is `clerkMiddleware()` used in `middleware.ts`?
2. **Layout**: Is `<ClerkProvider>` wrapping the app in `app/layout.tsx`?
3. **Imports**: Are references only from `@clerk/nextjs` or `@clerk/nextjs/server`?
4. **Pages vs. App Router**: Is the approach referencing the App Router (not `_app.tsx` or `pages/`)?

If any check **fails**, **stop** and revise until compliance is achieved.
